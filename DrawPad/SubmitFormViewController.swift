//   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
//   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

//   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
//   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
//   as of the date such litigation is filed.
//
//4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
//   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
//   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
//   meet the following conditions:
//
//   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

//
//   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
//       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
//       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
//       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
//       the Derivative Works; and
//
//   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
//       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
//       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
//       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
//       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
//       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
//       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
//       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
//       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
//       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
//       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
//       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
//       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
//       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
//       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
//       as modifying the License.
//
//   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
//   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
//   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
//   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

//   the conditions stated in this License.
//
//5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
//   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
//   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
//   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
//   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
//   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
//   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
//
//6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
//   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
//   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
//   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
//
//7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
//   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
//   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
//   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
//   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
//   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
//   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
//   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
//   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
//
//8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
//   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
//   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
//   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
//   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
//   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
//   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
//   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
//   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
//   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
//   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
//
//9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
//   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
//   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
//   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
//   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
//   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
//   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
//   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
//   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
//   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
//
//END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
